## Details
Dear Deep Learning community,

As expected, we need to (and should anyway) return to having our meetups online on Zoom, with a shorter program. 
Our next one takes place on December 1st, 18:30 CET.

Our agenda is as follows:

* Welcome & Introduction
* Introduction to Transformers with a focus on Computer Vision
* Announcements
* Transformers follow-up: What about audio?
* Networking (in Zoom breakout rooms)

Details:

Main talk: Introduction to Transformers with a focus on Computer Vision - Michael Pieler, contextflow
[[Slides](<./slides/VDLM_Transformers_with_a_focus_on_CV_20211201.pdf>)]

Transformers are a very interesting model architecture for deep learning that recently is getting more traction in computer vision. This talk aims to discuss the building blocks and setups of Transformers in general and will then go through selected publications with interesting applications.
Participants are encouraged to ask questions during the talk.

Short talk: Transformers follow-up: What about audio? - Jan Schlüter, JKU
[[Slides](<./slides/TODO.pdf>)]

Complementing the main talk, we will briefly look at selected works applying the Transformer architecture in the audio domain.
