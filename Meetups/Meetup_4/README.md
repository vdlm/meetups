Change in Plans!

On the day of our meetup there is the Webinar "Large-Scale Deep Learning with TensorFlow for Building Intelligent Systems" from 18:00 to 19:00 by Jeff Dean, leader of the Google Deep Learning research team, and Stephen Ibaraki from ACM.

So let's do the following:

17:45 - Gathering at the TU Wien Informatik-Gebäude, Favoritenstrasse 9-11, Vienna, Seminarraum Gödel (im Innenhof links)

18:00 - 19:00 - Watch the Webinar "Large-Scale Deep Learning with TensorFlow for Building Intelligent Systems" https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=lobby20.jsp&eventid=1187790&sessionid=1&key=A74EDF8175269CCCD3C6CA599A25D7C5&eventuserid=145388628

19:15 - Get together for a discussion & beers in the garden of Wieden Bräu, Waaggasse 5, Vienna

There we can follow up with discussions about the webinar and topics that are of interest to the group, such as:

• Experience with software frameworks

• Tips n tricks for training a network

• Interesting use cases

• Ethics in Deep Learning (Open AI, self-driving cars, etc.)

• (suggest more topics underneath this post...)

Looking forward to seeing you!

Cheers :-)
