## Details

Hello everyone,

we warmly invite you to our Deep Learning meetup on October 18, 2023, hosted by Zühlke in the Rivergate building at Handelskai! (Yes, there are two Deep Learning meetups in October!)

Our first speaker will be Liad Magen (TU Wien) presenting Extracting Gold from Your Paper Pile: State-of-the-art methods for information extraction from paper documents. As a second talk, Jan Schlüter (JKU Linz) will present Music Audio Generation in 2023: A selective review.

    Extracting Gold from Your Paper Pile: State-of-the-art methods for information extraction from paper documents

Liad Magen, TU Wien

Have you ever wondered how to extract useful information from visually rich documents, such as flyers, medical records, or invoices? Such documents are everywhere but are challenging to analyze since they are often composed of different layouts with diverse fonts and text sizes that convey meaning and context. Extracting information from such documents is a task that requires both natural language understanding and computer vision. In this talk, we will explore the exciting world of information extraction and present some of the latest advances in this field, such as new approaches for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engines, and the latest research on self-supervised transformers (the same building blocks of Large Language Models) which can handle multilingual text and its position. Whether you are a business owner, a researcher, or just curious, this talk will make you see those documents in a new light!

    Music Audio Generation in 2023: A selective review

Jan Schlüter, JKU Linz

Music audio generation is the task of generating music recordings either fully from scratch or based on some user input. This year alone has seen a flurry of newly proposed systems, often based on advances in neural audio compression. In this short talk, we will review some of 2023's works including the predecessors they build on, dissect their underlying architecture and composition of building blocks, and compare the different directions they take.
