Hello everyone,

we are pleased to invite you to the next Deep Learning Meetup on November 16, 2023 hosted by WU Wien.

The first speaker is one of the Meetup hosts himself - Alexander Schindler (AIT) - who will present results and findings from five years of consecutive research on identifying disinformation with deep learning and artificial intelligence.

The second talk, Meder Kamalov, will cover the applied topics of serving AI models, optimising model cold start times and a walkthrough of how to develop and deploy an AI model to an API endpoint.

Countering fake news with deep learning - a retrospective summary of five years of research

Alexander Schindler â€“ Austrian Institute of Technology

Disinformation is not only one of the great challenges of our time, but also a great challenge from the perspective of data science and machine learning. Not only is it a poorly defined concept that makes it difficult to define decision boundaries of classifiers, but it also spreads across every modality and can occur in any context. Requirements of users for detection range from verification of single instances to trend detection in social media channels through multi-instance analysis. Approaches range from end-to-end to complex content description pipelines. The latter also requires complex task and resource management, etc.
The presentation will outline the most important challenges, results and findings from various research projects. These include various deep learning solutions as well as findings from the development of large integrated multi-modal and multi-model systems.

From Development to Deployment: Leveraging 'fal' for Efficient AI Model Serving

Meder Kamalov -.

In this talk, we will delve into the intricacies of serving AI models, optimising cold start times, and the development and deployment of AI models to API endpoints. We will explore the practical application of fal, a powerful tool that facilitates these processes, through a comprehensive walkthrough of its functionality. This includes its ability to load and run AI models and its capacity to serve these models as API endpoints. The talk aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of these topics.
