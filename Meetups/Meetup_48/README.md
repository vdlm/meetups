## Details

Hi everyone,

please join us for our next meetup on February 28, at A1!

We will have a presentation by Marco Pasini (Johannes Kepler University) on Musika! Fast Infinite Waveform Music Generation, followed by a networking break!

For the second part of the evening Gabriele Libardi (Pompeu Fabra University / Trayport) will provide an overview on Neural program synthesis, followed by a Hot Papers session on Language Models & Prompt Engineering by Michael Pieler (OpenBioML.org & Stability.AI)!

Hope to see you there!

Rene, for the VDLM organizers

18:30 Welcome & Intro

18:45

    Musika! Fast Infinite Waveform Music Generation
    Marco Pasini, Johannes Kepler University
    State-of-the-art waveform music generation systems are slow at inference. We introduce Musika, a system that is able to generate coherent waveform music of arbitrary length much faster than real-time on a consumer CPU, and can be conditioned on tempo or note-density. We achieve this by incorporating a latent coordinate system and a style conditioning vector into a Generative Adversarial Network model.

    Neural Program Synthesis â€“ An Overview
    Gabriele Libardi, Pompeu Fabra University / Trayport
    This talk will give an overview of some papers in the field of program synthesis (i.e. synthesizing a program given some input-output examples), and of how Deep Learning is being used to enhance/replace previous techniques. It will also cover current challenges and a personal outlook on the future of this field.
    Hot Papers session: Language Models & Prompt Engineering
    Michael Pieler, OpenBioML.org & Stability.AI
