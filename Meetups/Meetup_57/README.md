## Talk Abstract: Artificial Intelligence for the Pen-and-Paper Game "SIM"

Paul has loved math and games since childhood. Over the last 5 years he has been using AI to teach his computer to learn and play all kind of games. He trained his computer to play TicTacToe, Jungle, Chess, and even NetHack - a dungeons and dragons single player console game. Then he stumbled upon the pen-and-paper game "SIM". SIM is so easy to explain and so easy to play that he instantly fell in love with it. He programmed it on one evening with Python and let his computer play and
learn it overnight with a simplified implementation of self-play based reinforcement learning based on the AlphaGo Zero paper (Silver et al). Join this talk to see the results, to learn how to set it up on your own and finally to play a game versus the AI yourself. If you dare.
