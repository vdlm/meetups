**Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning: Advancements and Challenges**
*Martin Trapp, Aalto University, Helsinki*

Deep Learning and other contemporary machine learning tools are nowadays used in a large array of real-world applications and have successfully made the transfer from academia to industry. However, those tools are often developed solely with the aim to boost predictive performance (e.g., accuracy).

While high predictive performance on a test set is clearly valuable, it is insufficient to achieve a level of reliability that is needed for many applications. In fact, by ignoring factors such as different sources of uncertainties we make our models more vulnerable to adversarial attacks, noise in the inputs, and label noise in the training data. Moreover, accounting for sources of uncertainties is crucial in safety-critical applications, active learning, or when identifying and communicating failure modes.

In this talk, our speaker will discuss some of the recent advancements in the field of uncertainty quantification in Deep Learning and highlight open challenges. The talk will contain a mix of works in the field and works by the presenter and will be aimed at a general audience.

[Martin Trapp](https://trappmartin.github.io/website) is a research council of Finland funded senior postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, working on uncertainty quantification in Deep Learning, tractability, and other topics related to probabilistic machine learning. Martin is co-organiser of various workshops including the workshop on [uncertainty quantification for computer vision](https://uncertainty-cv.github.io/2024/) at ECCV 2024, organises the ELLIS seminar on [advancements in probabilistic machine learning](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/), and is guest editor of the Entropy special issue on [advancements in probabilistic machine learning](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/special_issues/probabilistic_ML). Before joining Aalto University, Martin did his PhD at TU Graz under supervision of Prof. Franz Pernkopf and Robert Peharz and simultaneously worked at the Austrian research institute for AI in Vienna. Martin is generally interested in making machine learning more reliable and trustworthy through probabilistic and neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Thanks to Canva hosting us at MyHive.
We are looking forward to seeing you at our next meetup!
