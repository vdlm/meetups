**Talk 1: Deep Learning in Medical Imaging Applications** 
Isabel Dregely
[[Slides](<./slides/Deep Learning in Medical Imaging Applications.pdf>)]

Machine learning and in particular Deep Learning is a key driver in enabling a transition from qualitative to quantitative imaging biomarkers and towards personalized medicine. Using the example of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, this talk will show how deep learning has been applied to the entire image processing chain, from acquisition, image reconstruction to image analysis and disease prediction to enable faster image exams and more reproducible results.

Isabel Dregely has studied physics. Her research interest is in developing new methods for medical imaging. One example is encoding functional information into image data to not just detect cancer on images but further be able to assess aggressiveness. She has been a researcher at Harvard in Boston, UC Los Angeles, TU München and King’s College in London. Since June 2021 she is leading a team in teaching and research in many applications of data analytics and AI at the FH Technikum Wien.

**Talk 2: Trends from Silicon Valley: Deep Learning and Mobility**
Georg Fuerlinger
[[Slides](<./slides/Silicon Valley_Mobility Innovation_Dr_Georg_Fuerlinger.pdf>)]


This short talk presents a brief overview of the trends in Silicon Valley, followed by specific DL and AI applications in the mobility sector, focusing on selected startups.

Dr. Georg Fuerlinger received his doctorate from the Technical University of Vienna and holds a master's degree in international business from the Vienna University of Economics and Business. He established the Austrian Innovation Office in Silicon Valley from 2016-2021, as part of the Austrian Trade Commission. Georg and his team supported more than 1000 new and established companies with their US market entry strategy as well as with technology, partner and investor search in Silicon Valley. He previously worked with Stanford University's startup accelerator StartX and was a lecturer at the New York Institute of Technology. He is co-author of the book "Abseits von Silicon Valley" (Beyond Silicon Valley) and advises, publishes and presents in the areas of innovation, entrepreneurship and technology trends.

**Talk 3: Hot Topics and Latest News in Deep Learning**
Michael Pieler

Our regular section to present you the latest & hottest research output in Deep Learning in a quick way.


After the talks we'll have time for networking amongst the community. FH Technikum will kindly provide drinks and snacks!

Looking forward to seeing you in real-life again!
