## Details

Hello everyone,

we hope you had a great summer and invite you to our next Deep Learning meetup on September 13, 2023, hosted by the University of Vienna in the Biology Building!

Our first speaker will be Adrian Braşoveanu (Modul University Vienna) presenting From Transformers to Large Language Models: A review of the last six years. We will have Bogdan Pirvu (Novomatic) present about LLM Application Development - How to use ChatGPT and other Large Language Models to build reliable systems as the second talk.

* From Transformers to Large Language Models: A review of the last six years

Adrian Braşoveanu, Modul University Vienna

During the last 6 years (2017–2023) in NLP, we have experienced the rapid rise of Transformers and their growth from small pre-trained language models (PLMs) to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to innovative techniques like Knowledge Distillation and Mixture of Experts (MoE).

We will start with a brief introduction on how Transformers see text and early attempts to debug Transformers through visualizations.

We will then describe the evolution that happened in 3 stages:

1. Transformer – the discovery of the transformer architecture (BERT, RoBERTa)
2. GPT-2 and the rise of domain-specific architectures (e.g., T5, FinBERT, BERTopic) – significant increase in the number of parameters and the large scale adoption of transfer learning techniques (e.g., zero-shot and few-shot learning).
3. GPT-3/Claude 2 and the open-source LLMs – the rapid development of prompt engineering and interesting problem-solving strategies like CoT, ToT, CoS, and others.

For each stage, we will also examine a paper or two from our own research to understand how NLP research changed in this period:

* for the 1st generation – sentiment analysis
* for the 2nd generation – CrudeBERt and BERTopic classification
* for the 3rd generation – relation extraction evaluation

* LLM Application Development - How to use ChatGPT and other Large Language Models to build reliable systems

Bogdan Pirvu, Head of Data Science at Novomatic

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have revolutionized the field of Artificial Intelligence, demonstrating immense potential for their application in various industries. This talk delves into the emerging paradigm of LLM Application Development, focusing on harnessing LLMs as the logic engine to drive highly engaging and personalized user experiences in modern applications. Specifically, we'll be looking at:

* the benefits of using LLMs for decision-making and user assistance
* the challenges of integrating LLMs into larger applications: predictability & maintainability
* a framework to deal with these challenges
