## Details

Hey everyone,

please join us next week on Oct 18 for two very exciting talks!

First Lukas Zimmermann (dreamwaves.io) will present an Intro to Neural Radiance Fields and how they allow to freely generate images of an object from arbitrary viewpoints given only a few input images! He will also show how this technique can be used in a medical setting for image reconstruction!

Then Michael Pieler (contextflow.com) will give an in-depth answer to a question I guess many of us had in the last couple of weeks, when staring at images that were AI-generated from a text prompt: How the heck does Stable Diffusion work??

We are aware that the meetup is taking place on very short notice, but we hope you can make it!

For the VDLM team,

Rene
