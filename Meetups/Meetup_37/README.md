In this talk René (CTO at contextflow) will give an overview over the NeurIPS conference that took place recently in December 2020, distilling emerging topics and trends from the keynotes, submitted publications and special interest workshops. As usually, we'll have room for Q&A with the speaker.

Afterwards we'll have time for networking amongst the community in breakout groups. Have your snacks & drinks ready ;-)
